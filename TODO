FOR 2.0
 - Allow the configuration to be overridden by command-line flags.
 - Document the fact that the configuration can be specified on the commandline.
 - implement the color command  ${color #121212}.
 - deprecate the prompt settings in the config file and instead, if no template
   is specified, construct one from the existing flags.
 - document "~" as a default alias.
 - review all the uses of sizeof on wchar buffers (need to be divided).
 - all the calls to mbstowcs and vice-versa should be audited, maybe wrappers
   should be written...
 - Split prwd and prwdrc configuration man pages.
 - if prwd's argv[0] is different, call the internal funcs.
 - allow for prwd -t "path -n"
 - Convert the man pages to mandoc?
 - Load all the environment variables starting with '/' and resolving to
   existing path as aliases.
 - Properly escape the exports in dump_alias_vars in order to work with space
   folders.
 - Allow for a fully templated PS1, e.g.

 	${hostname}:${branch}:${path}${uid}

   But if we aren't in a source control repo, it would look like:

   	host::/tmp$

   Which is why the "sep" command could be introduced:

	${hostname}:${branch}${sep :}${path}${uid}

   If any dynamic token around the sep command are empty, the separator is not
   shown.

 - Allow users to define separate templates based on conditions:

    - UID? username?
    - in a source control repo?
    - by path?
    - date/time?
    - uname/os? (emoji?)

   These could be defined similarly to Host lines in ssh_config.
