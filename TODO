FOR 1.9
 - Load all the environment variables starting with '/' and resolving to
   existing path as aliases.
 - Allow the configuration to be overridden by command-line flags.
 - Properly escape the exports in dump_alias_vars in order to work with space
   folders.
 - Allow for a fully templated PS1, e.g.

 	{hostname}:{prefixed_path}{uid_indicator}

 - Maybe even better, multiple templates conditionally, conditions could be:

    - UID? username?
    - in a source control repo?
    - by path?
    - date/time?

   Not sure if the conditions should be handled by prwd or externally.
