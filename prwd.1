.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm prwd
.Op Fl Vh
.Op Fl t Ar template
.Nm prwd
.Op Fl a
.Nm prwd

.Nm prwd
.Op Fl F Ar filename
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a replacement for your shell's PS1, it provides a simple templating language
with commands to customize your prompt.
.Nm
keeps your prompt consistent between shells, provides fast template commands to
display contextual information such as hostname, path, current git/hg branch
without an inordinate amount of slow shell scripting.
.Pp
The command-line options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl V
Show current version.
.It Fl h
Show usage.
.It Fl t Ar template
Use the provided template instead of the one defined in the configuration file
or the one defined in the environment variable PRWD.  This is particularly useful
for testing a new template.  Use single quote (') around your template to avoid
your shell to expand the $ variable.
.It Fl a
Outputs all the aliases starting with '$' as shell variable exports. The output
from this command is meant to be used with eval in your .profile file, see
section ALIAS VARIABLES in the
.It Fl f
Print the closest project root in the parent hierarchy. The first folder with a
\&.git or .hg folder will be returned, as fallback it will find the first folder
with a README file. This is particularly helpful within a custom alias pairing
cd and prwd -f together.
.It Fl F Ar filename
Same as above except it will only look for a folder with the given filename.

.El
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
.Nm
can read its template from a configuration file, a command-line parameters or the
following environment variable:
.Bl -tag -width REMOTEHOST
.It Ev PRWD
The template used to render your prompt.  This value will override the default
internal template and can be overridden by the configuration file.
.El
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width ~/.prwdrc -compact
.It Pa ~/.prwdrc
defines all the configuration, overrides PRWD and the internal defaults.  See
.Xr prwdrc 5
for configuratiom syntax and parameters.
.El
.Sh SETUP
You'll need to place this line in your ~/.profile (your mileage may vary):
.Bd -literal -offset indent
export PS1='`prwd`'
