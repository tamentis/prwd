FOR 1.9
    - Allow for a fully templated PS1, e.g.

        {hostname}:{prefixed_path}{uid_indicator}

        - format should be flexible for users to type any crap and add any
          unicode nonsense they feel like adding.

        - we could consider opt-based functions:
       
            [${time %H:%M:%s}] ${hostname -s}:${path --newsgroup}${uid}

        - we're gonna need to accept fork-exec() in some fashion, even if it is
          bound to be abused.
     
            ${exec whoami}
      
      The command+options style looks like executable commands, I'm almost
      tempted to add some form of namespacing to make it extra obvious that the
      commands are internal. For example:

        {i:hostname -s}:{i:path newsgroup}

      While accepting external commands:

        {i:hostname -s}:{x:ls -l}

      Since these commands are essentially just command line arguments, there
      is value in allowing the user to call them from the command line as well:

        prwd hostname -s

      Would it be better to keep it to a single command format?

        prwd hostname-short
        prwd path-newsgroupize

      While the simplicity is appealing, it makes it difficult to do something
      like a date format:

        prwd date VS prwd time %Y-%m-%s

      What would I prefer to use:

        [{time}] {hostname -s}:{path -n}{uid}

      What I will have to use:

        [${time}] ${hostname -s}:${path -n}${uid}
        -or-
        [{time}] ${hostname -s}:${path -n}${uid}

 - Split prwd and prwdrc configuration man pages and turn README into a proper
   githubesque thing.

 - Allow the configuration to be overridden by command-line flags.

 - Load all the environment variables starting with '/' and resolving to
   existing path as aliases.

 - Properly escape the exports in dump_alias_vars in order to work with space
   folders.

 - Maybe even better, multiple templates conditionally, conditions could be:

    - UID? username?
    - in a source control repo
    - path
    - date/time
    - hostname

   Not sure if the conditions should be handled by prwd or externally. This is an
   example configuration:

	if (hostname == "lab") {
		template = "{foo}:{bar}"
	}

   And another, based on context:

   	Context AtWork
		Hostname lab
		Domain truveris
		Template {foo}:{bar}

   Another:

   	(
		hostname = lab

 - Advantages of prwd to document properly:
    - a single fork instead of fork-exec git and hg.
    - small in-stack memory footprint
    - compiled and fast
    - same prompt on all systems
