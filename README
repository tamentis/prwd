prwd - print reduced working directory
======================================

INTRO
    Prints the working directory with a few 'enhancements' from pwd:

     - aliases
     - max length and filler characters
     - newsgroup style

    All of this is driven by your ~/.prwdrc file.

    The reasoning behind 'prwd' is that most shells read $PS1 differently and
    have a very rigid way to display the current working directory. 'prwd'
    allows you to have one way to handle the display of your working directory
    and use it across multiple shells. 
    
    The syntax of the configuration files is described below, lines starting
    with '#' are ignored.

ALIASES
    Defines a replacement name for a long path, for example, if you had the
    following line in your prwdrc:

        alias *prwd /home/tamentis/projects/prwd

    Then if you are in "/home/tamentis/projects/prwd/doc/html/", prwd would
    return "*prwd/doc/html". If you have spaces in your directories, you can
    wrap your 'alias' parameters with double quotes:

        alias winDocs "/mnt/Windows XP/My Documents/"

MAX LENGTH
    Defines the maximum length to return, the default filler string is "...",
    the default length is 32, a value of 0 will disable the feature all
    together.

        set maxlength 20

    This setting would turn "~/projects/prwd/doc/html" into a shorter string:
    "...cts/prwd/doc/html". You can define the filler string with the 'filler'
    variable:

        set filler "-"

    Or if your font/terminal/shell supports UTF:

        set filler "â€¦"

    If you want prwd to keep complete path elements instead of cutting as much
    as possible, you can use this setting:

        set cleancut on

NEWSGROUP STYLE
    This will shorten the path by only displaying the first letter of each path
    components, toggle it with:

        set newsgroup on

    This will turn the "/home/tamentis/projects/prwd/src/nowhere" path into
    "/h/t/p/s/nowhere". Note that the newsgroup style filter is applied before
    the path is trimmed with 'maxlength'.

INSTALL
    make
    sudo make install

SETUP
    This will depend on your shell, but in general the following will do:

        export PS1='\h:`prwd`\p '

    Note that the single quote matters since you want to keep the command
    within the variable as-is (unresolved).
