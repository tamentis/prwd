 - Check if we are in a symlink?

 - Allow the configuration to be overridden by command-line flags.

 - You should be able to use aliases within aliases. For example:

     alias $tp /tmp/that/directory
     alias $new $tp/new

 - When there are multiple definitions of the same alias, check which ones
   point to an existing directory. If multiple do, use the last one.
