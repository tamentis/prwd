.Sh NAME
.Nm prwd
.Nd print reduced working directory
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm prwd
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
prints the absolute pathname of the current working directory to the standard
output. It is similar to
.Nm pwd
but has a configuration file (~/.prwdrc) allowing the following features:
.Pp
  - aliases
  - max length and filler characters
  - newsgroup style
  - mercurial and git branches
.Pp
Most shells read $PS1 differently and have a very rigid way to display the
current working directory.
.Nm
allows you to have one way to handle the display of your working directory
and use it across multiple shells. It also has awareness of a few version
control system (git and mercurial) and will display the current branch
when you enter a project under version control.
.Pp
The syntax of the configuration files is described below, lines starting
with '#' are ignored.
.Sh ALIASES
Defines a replacement name for a long path, for example, if you had the
following line in your prwdrc:
.Pp
    alias *prwd /home/tamentis/projects/prwd
.Pp
Then if you are in "/home/tamentis/projects/prwd/doc/html/", prwd would
return "*prwd/doc/html". If you have spaces in your directories, you can
wrap your 'alias' parameters with double quotes:
.Pp
    alias winDocs "/mnt/Windows XP/My Documents/"
.Pp
You can define multiple values for a single alias, this allows you to share
your configuration on different machines, but keep the same alias, for
example:
.Pp
    alias $tp /home/tamentis/truveris/projects
    alias $tp /Users/tamentis/truveris/projects
.Sh MAX LENGTH
Defines the maximum length to return, the default filler string is "...",
the default length is 32, a value of 0 will disable the feature all
together.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
set maxlength 20
.Ed
.Pp
This setting would turn "~/projects/prwd/doc/html" into a shorter string:
"...cts/prwd/doc/html". You can define the filler string with the 'filler'
variable:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
set filler "-"
.Ed
.Pp
Or if your font/terminal/shell supports UTF:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
set filler "â€¦"
.Ed
.Pp
If you want
.Nm
to keep complete path elements instead of cutting as much
as possible, you can use this setting:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
set cleancut on
.Ed
.Sh NEWSGROUP STYLE
This will shorten the path by only displaying the first letter of each path
components, toggle it with:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
set newsgroup on
.Ed
.Pp
This will turn the "/home/tamentis/projects/prwd/src/nowhere" path into
"/h/t/p/s/nowhere". Note that the newsgroup style filter is applied before
the path is trimmed with 'maxlength'.
.Sh MERCURIAL
You can see the currently selected branch as a prefix to your path
whenever you are in a mercurial repository, enable this feature with
the following option:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
set mercurial on
.Ed
.Pp
The resulting path will be "my-branch:project/folder".
.Sh GIT
You can see the currently HEAD position as a prefix to your path when you
are in a git repository, you can enable this feature with the following
option:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
set git on
.Ed
.Pp
The resulting path will be "my-branch:project/folder" if you are located on
the HEAD of a branch, it will be "59cefd9...:project/folder" if you are
anywhere else.
.Sh SETUP
This will depend on your shell, but the following will usually do:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
export PS1='\\h:`prwd`\\p '
.Ed
.Pp
Note that the single quote matters since you want to keep the command
within the variable as-is (unresolved).
