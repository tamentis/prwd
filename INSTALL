prwd - installation notes
=========================

INSTALLATION
    ./configure
    make
    sudo make install


PDKSH AND SYMLINKS
    If you use pdksh or OpenBSD's ksh, since PWD is not exported by default,
    prwd won't be able to display path with symlinks properly. You can fix
    that by adding the following like to your ~/.profile or ~/.kshrc:

        export PWD


RELEASE
    1. Change the version in ``configure``,
    2. Update the distrib/ files,
    3. Tag the new branch:

        git tag -a vX.Y -m 'Releasing vX.Y'
        git push --tags

    4. Download the file from github (release section),
    5. Sign it:
