prwd - print reduced working directory
======================================

INTRO
    Prints the working directory with a few 'enhancements' from pwd:

     - aliases
     - max length and filler characters
     - newsgroup style
     - mercurial and git branches

    All of this is driven by your ~/.prwdrc file.

    The reasoning behind 'prwd' is that most shells read $PS1 differently and
    have a very rigid way to display the current working directory. 'prwd'
    allows you to have one way to handle the display of your working directory
    and use it across multiple shells. 
    
    The syntax of the configuration files is described below, lines starting
    with '#' are ignored.

ALIASES
    Defines a replacement name for a long path, for example, if you had the
    following line in your prwdrc:

        alias *prwd /home/tamentis/projects/prwd

    Then if you are in "/home/tamentis/projects/prwd/doc/html/", prwd would
    return "*prwd/doc/html". If you have spaces in your directories, you can
    wrap your 'alias' parameters with double quotes:

        alias winDocs "/mnt/Windows XP/My Documents/"

    You can define multiple values for a single alias, this allows you to share
    your configuration on different machines, but keep the same alias, for
    example::
        
	alias $tp /home/tamentis/truveris/projects
	alias $tp /Users/tamentis/truveris/projects

MAX LENGTH
    Defines the maximum length to return, the default filler string is "...",
    the default length is 32, a value of 0 will disable the feature all
    together.

        set maxlength 20

    This setting would turn "~/projects/prwd/doc/html" into a shorter string:
    "...cts/prwd/doc/html". You can define the filler string with the 'filler'
    variable:

        set filler "-"

    Or if your font/terminal/shell supports UTF:

        set filler "â€¦"

    If you want prwd to keep complete path elements instead of cutting as much
    as possible, you can use this setting:

        set cleancut on

NEWSGROUP STYLE
    This will shorten the path by only displaying the first letter of each path
    components, toggle it with:

        set newsgroup on

    This will turn the "/home/tamentis/projects/prwd/src/nowhere" path into
    "/h/t/p/s/nowhere". Note that the newsgroup style filter is applied before
    the path is trimmed with 'maxlength'.

MERCURIAL
    You can see the currently selected branch as a prefix to your path
    whenever you are in a mercurial repository, enable this feature with
    the following option:

        set mercurial on

    The resulting path will be "my-branch:project/folder".

GIT
    You can see the currently HEAD position as a prefix to your path when you
    are in a git repository, you can enable this feature with the following
    option:

        set git on

    The resulting path will be "my-branch:project/folder" if you are located on
    the HEAD of a branch, it will be "59cefd9...:project/folder" if you are
    anywhere else.

INSTALL
    make
    sudo make install

SETUP
    This will depend on your shell, but in general the following will do:

        export PS1='\h:`prwd`\p '

    Note that the single quote matters since you want to keep the command
    within the variable as-is (unresolved).
