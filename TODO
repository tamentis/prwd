FOR 2.0

    [core] drop separator conditionally -OR- conditional templates

        ${hostname}:${branch}${sep :}${path}${uid}

        If any dynamic token around the sep command are empty, the separator is
        not shown.

        Not sure if the conditions should be handled by prwd or externally.
        This is an example configuration:
     
     	if (hostname == "lab") {
     		template = "{foo}:{bar}"
     	}
     
        And another, based on context:
     
        	Context AtWork
     		Hostname lab
     		Domain truveris
     		Template {foo}:{bar}

    [cmd] Add an ${exec whoami} command.  Even if bound to be abused.
    [doc] Split prwd and prwdrc configuration man pages and turn README into a proper githubesque thing.
    [doc] Document "~" as a default alias
    [doc] Explain advantages:
        - a single fork instead of fork-exec git and hg.
        - small in-stack memory footprint
        - compiled and fast
        - same prompt on all systems


FOR LATER
    
    [alias] Load all the environment variables starting with '/' and resolving to existing path as aliases.
    [alias] Properly escape the exports in dump_alias_vars in order to work with space folders.
    [ui] if prwd's argv[0] is different, call the internal funcs.


AUDIT

    review all the uses of sizeof on wchar buffers (need to be divided).
    all the calls to mbstowcs and vice-versa should be audited, maybe wrappers should be written...
