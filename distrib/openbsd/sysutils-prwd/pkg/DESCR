Prints the working directory with a few 'enhancements' from pwd:

 - aliases
 - max length and filler characters
 - newsgroup style

All of this is driven by your ~/.prwdrc file.

The reasoning behind 'prwd' is that most shells read $PS1 differently and
have a very rigid way to display the current working directory. 'prwd'
allows you to have one way to handle the display of your working directory
and use it across multiple shells.
