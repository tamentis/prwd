 - Allow the configuration to be overridden by command-line flags.

 - You should be able to use aliases within aliases. For example:

     alias $tp /tmp/that/directory
     alias $new $tp/new

 - When there are multiple definitions of the same alias, check which ones
   point to an existing directory. That's for '-a'. The only way to do that is
   to expand the aliases if needed.

 - Make sure the return from getenv("PWD") and getcwd() is the same before
   using for former.
