1.9.1 Bertrand Janin <b@janin.com> (2015-05-20)

	* Fix newsgroup mode not using aliases (found by @twidi, fixes #7).
	* Fix broken nested aliases (found by @twidi, fixes #8).

1.9 Bertrand Janin <b@janin.com> (2015-04-12)

	* Implemented fully templated mode.  All older options are obsolete
	  and used in this version as fallback for the template.
	* Add command to adjust color in template.
	* Add commadn to add timestamp/date in template.
	* Fix a bug in newsgroup mode affecting one-level deep paths starting
	  with an alias or '~' (found by Jens Schleusener).
	* Split man page between prwd(1) and prwdrc(5).

1.8 Bertrand Janin <b@janin.com> (2013-08-25)

	* Added set hostname configuration flag to prefix the hostname.
	* Added set uid_indicator configuration flag to suffix $ or #
	  depending on whether the user is root or not.
	* If the parent shell allows it, use PWD to get the current directory,
	  this allows prwd to grab the context of the parent shell and show
	  symlinks appropriately.
	* Where there are multiple definitions of the same alias, check which
	  ones point to an existing directory (for -a dump). Resolve aliases
	  one level deep if needed.
	* Allow one level of nested aliases (only as prefix).

1.7 Bertrand Janin <b@janin.com> (2013-05-25)

	* Added -a flag that prints all the aliases starting with '$' in a
	  format that could be passed to eval with eval `prwd -a`. Allowing
	  aliases to be used with other tools via shell variables.
	* Lots of tweaks to the configure and Makefiles to accomodate
	  rpmbuild.

	  Stéphane Angel)
