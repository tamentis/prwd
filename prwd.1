.Sh NAME
.Nm prwd
.Nd return reduced working directory name
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm prwd
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility prints the absolute pathname of the current working directory to
the standard output. It is similar to
.Nm pwd
but has a configuration file (~/.pwdrc) allowing the following features:

     - aliases
     - max length and filler characters
     - newsgroup style

The reasoning behind 'prwd' is that most shells read $PS1 differently and
have a very rigid way to display the current working directory. 'prwd'
allows you to have one way to handle the display of your working directory
and use it across multiple shells. 

The syntax of the configuration files is described below, lines starting
with '#' are ignored.

.Sh ALIASES
Defines a replacement name for a long path, for example, if you had the
following line in your prwdrc:

    alias *prwd /home/tamentis/projects/prwd

Then if you are in "/home/tamentis/projects/prwd/doc/html/", prwd would
return "*prwd/doc/html". If you have spaces in your directories, you can
wrap your 'alias' parameters with double quotes:

    alias winDocs "/mnt/Windows XP/My Documents/"

.Sh MAX LENGTH
Defines the maximum length to return, the default filler string is "...",
the default length is 32, a value of 0 will disable the feature all
together.

    set maxlength 20

This setting would turn "~/projects/prwd/doc/html" into a shorter string:
"...cts/prwd/doc/html". You can define the filler string with the 'filler'
variable:

    set filler "-"

Or if your font/terminal/shell supports UTF:

    set filler "â€¦"

If you want prwd to keep complete path elements instead of cutting as much
as possible, you can use this setting:

    set cleancut on

.Sh NEWSGROUP STYLE
    This will shorten the path by only displaying the first letter of each path
    components, toggle it with:

        set newsgroup on

    This will turn the "/home/tamentis/projects/prwd/src/nowhere" path into
    "/h/t/p/s/nowhere". Note that the newsgroup style filter is applied before
    the path is trimmed with 'maxlength'.

.Sh SETUP
    This will depend on your shell, but here are a few:

     - ksh (~/.profile or ~/.kshrc):
        export PS1='\\h:`prwd`\\p '

     - bash
     - zsh
     - csh
     - tcsh

    Note that the single quote matters since you want to keep the command
    within the variable as-is (unresolved).

.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr pwd 1 ,
.Xr csh 1 ,
.Xr ksh 1 ,
.Xr sh 1 ,
.Xr getcwd 3
.Sh BUGS
None so far.
