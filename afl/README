AFL TESTS

    Tools to run sub-systems of prwd through AFL.  The Makefile is quite hacky
    and goes outside of the tree to pick up files required to build the tests.
    You can run the tests individually with for example:

        make run-template

    Which will compile all the .c file to .o files in the ../src directory,
    copy them with their headers in here, compile the template program which is
    a stub reading templates from stdin and run afl-fuzz on it.
