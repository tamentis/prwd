FOR 2.0

    [core] conditional templates

        Not sure if the conditions should be handled by prwd or externally.
        This is an example configuration:
     
     	if (hostname == "lab") {
     		template = "{foo}:{bar}"
     	}
     
        And another, based on context:
     
        	Context AtWork
     		Hostname lab
     		Domain truveris
     		Template {foo}:{bar}

        Maybe template could be laid vertically:

            template in vcs {
                date
                space
                hostname
                branch
                optional :
                path -l 24
                uid
                space
            }

        User can define conditions based on UID, username, repo, path,
        date/time, una,e, os, etc.

    [cmd] Add an ${exec whoami} command.  Even if bound to be abused.


FOR LATER
    
    [alias] Load all the environment variables starting with '/' and resolving to existing path as aliases.
    [alias] Properly escape the exports in dump_alias_vars in order to work with space folders.
    [ui] if prwd's argv[0] is different, call the internal funcs.
    [core] deprecate config flags
    [core] allow user to access env variables


AUDIT

    review all the uses of sizeof on wchar buffers (need to be divided).
    all the calls to mbstowcs and vice-versa should be audited, maybe wrappers should be written...
